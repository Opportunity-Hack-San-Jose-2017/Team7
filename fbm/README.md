# Set up
`npm install`
Install ngrok http://ngrok.com/
Make a .env file with content like so:
```
PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN=<Facebook_page_token>
```
run use ``npm start``
`ngrok http 1337`

notes:
running npm start will start nodemon, which will watch and restart changes to 
index.js so you don't need to refresh the server everytime. 
port number is 1337
TODO: set up nodemon to watch for all js file changes
